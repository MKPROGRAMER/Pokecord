# Pokecord

:bangbang: | Pokecord is currently undergoing a full rewrite—if you're looking to contribute, please be advised that I do not intend to make too many changes to the current version.
:---: | :---

A Pokémon-oriented Discord bot that lets you collect pokémon. Catch pokémon in the wild, level your pokémon, compete with your friends, and more.

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions. Please, however, make an issue first if you want to contribute to the bot.

Right now, the code's still quite convoluted. I am working on refactoring and reorganizing the project.

## Roadmap

I'm looking to add the following major features to the bot, in addition to QoL fixes and small updates:

- Pokémon
	- Generation of pokémon
	- The rest of the forms
	- Gender differences
	- More customizations options, like Pokéballs
- Battling
	- Different modes (1v1, 3v3, team battles, etc.)
	- TMs and HMs
	- Abilities
	- Fully implementing status moves
	- A way to train EVs
	- Cosmetics like custom backgrounds
- Other
	- Daily/weekly quests with rewards
	- Achievements/profile badges
	- Egg hatching
	- Generally more customization options
